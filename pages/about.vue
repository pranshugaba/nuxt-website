    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a PhD student in Theoretical Computer Science.</p>
    <p>
      I click pictures, write poetry, create puzzles, draw comics, develop apps
      and games, and write stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also love playing chess, solving puzzles, swimming and cycling but not
      both at once.
    </p>
    <p>I am currently reading The Hobbit, or There and Back again.</p>
