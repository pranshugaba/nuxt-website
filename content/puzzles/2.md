For the second puzzle of [Mardi Maths](/puzzles), we have a chess puzzle!

Recall how chess pieces move:

- Rooks move in straight lines up, down, left, or right.
- Bishops can move diagonally.
- Queens can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally.
- Kings can move one step in any direction.
- Pawns attack forward-left or forward-right.
- Knight move in an L-shaped pattern. Two steps forward and one step sideways.

You can practice the pieces' movements on

## The Problem

You are trying to place as many white pieces on the board as possible such that no piece attacks any other piece.
For the sake of this problem, assume that pieces can attack other pieces of the same colour.

_Tip:_ You may find it helpful to play around with pieces on a board on the

Here are 7 variants of this problem:

### 1

What is the maximum number of rooks you can place on a $8\times 8$ chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other?

The following figure shows an arrangement of rooks that does not work.
