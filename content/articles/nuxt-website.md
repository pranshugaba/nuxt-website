This site is built using using Nuxt.js, which is a framework for Vue.js. I was previously using Hugo with the Academic theme. Hugo sites build extremely fast, and it is very easy to use. There are a lot of user-submitted themes available on Hugo's website, but I wasn't happy with most of them. 

I liked the Academic theme but I saw many others using the same theme, so I would have to customize the theme significantly to make my site unique. 
The Academic theme has since been renamed to Wowchemy and I do not like the direction it is proceeding in. 

I have been interested in Vue.js for some time now, and wanted to see if I can make a site using Vue. I had been doing Android development using Jetpack Compose, and I was enjoying the component based declarative UI. I tried out Gridsome (learned some GraphQL) and Next.js (learned React) before ending up with Nuxt.js.

I have learnt some Vue.js. I did the theming and styling from scratch.
