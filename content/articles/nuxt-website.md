This site is built using using Nuxt.js, a framework for Vue.js. <NavigationExtLink to="https://hugo.pranshugaba.com">My previous website</NavigationExtLink> was built using Hugo with the Academic theme. While Hugo sites build extremely fast, and are easy to get started with, I was not entirely satisfied with the experience. There are a lot of user-submitted themes available on Hugo's website, but I wasn't happy with most of them.

I liked the Academic theme but I saw many others using the same theme, so I would have to customize the theme significantly to make my site unique. The Academic theme has since been renamed to Wowchemy and I did not like the direction it is proceeding in.

I have been interested in Vue.js for some time now, and wanted to see if I can make a site using Vue. I had been doing Android development using Jetpack Compose, and I was enjoying the component based declarative UI.

I tried out Gridsome (learned some GraphQL) and Next.js (learned React) before ending up with Nuxt.js.
I have learnt some Vue.js. I did the theming and styling from scratch.
